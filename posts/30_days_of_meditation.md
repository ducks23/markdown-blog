&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I would like to start a 30 day challenge of meditating. I used to meditate quite a lot when I was around 23-24. I started doing a lot of yoga in college because I had a really good yoga teacher. At the start of every class she would say sit down, close your eyes, cross your legs, straighten your spine, and have the top of your head extend towards the ceiling. Thats it. It’s that simple to meditate. We would sit for 5-10 minutes focusing on our breathing before starting an hour long yoga class. I really loved doing it. There was no music in the class, just about 10-15 people in a room challenging themselves mentally and physically. Everyone has their own baggage going around in their head and personal reasons why they do yoga or do spiritual practices but everyone agrees that they feel better after doing yoga or praying together. It’s something that people have been doing for as long as recorded history.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As I work from home, typing away on my computer completely alone with my dog, I have been neglecting meditating. Habits are such a funny thing, you can get really good at them and then one wrench can be thrown at your life and you’re back to square one. I also used to lift weights weekly. Now I haven’t been to the gym in months. Getting a puppy messed up my daily breathing exercises in the morning because I would wake up and be so apprehensive about the puppy defecating all over my 600 sq ft apartment. I restructured my mornings by taking out the dog on walks and making sure it was getting trained, thus neglecting myself and I wouldn’t have it any other way. My puppy is the best.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  At this point I have settled into dog ownership and I want to focus on getting more control over my mind and my thoughts. That is why I love to meditate. Meditating creates space in your mind. And there is good science behind it as well. When you change the brainwaves and slow down the cycles of your mind, creativity increases and cortisol (fight or flight chemical) lowers. And in christian spirituality you escape the carnal mind and come to adopt the Mind of Christ. Or in yoga you move energy up your spine through your chakras and awaken the kundalini energy inside. Either way it's ascending to a higher state of consciousness. Seems to be universal in all religions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Anyways this is day 1. I accomplished my meditation by sitting down and counting to 60 breaths. It wasn’t easy but I did it. You have to start somewhere. This is just a personal blog I don’t intend on this being perfectly written or proof read I would just like to document a bit of my life and thoughts.
