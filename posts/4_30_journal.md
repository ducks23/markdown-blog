# Day 4 / I Have Ascended

It is the 4th day of me sitting down and meditating for 15-20 minutes and I have reached full enlightenment and am in a constant state of nirvana. I can telepathically communicate with animals. I am able to levitate with the power of my mind. 

Just kidding but I have been enjoying the practice. I still don't really know what I'm doing with this blog but I want it to be enjoyable for the reader and don't want them to be here too long. I'm continuing to work on the blog so that I can create an email list and have subscribers be sent emails.

It's the middle of the work day for me and I can't spend too much writing. Cheers.

I did want to talk about why I meditate though. I feel like in the last couple of years I've lost a bit of peace in my life. I used to be able to go on long walks and not care to look at my phone. I used to come home and sit on the couch and just listen to music and just think for a while. I have been lost in the sea of scrolling the internet and I think it is due to anxiety and drinking. I moved to austin texas and went out and got drunk and partied almost every weekend abusing caffeine and cigarettes and alcohol and I think it has had an effect on my brain. After the weekend I wouldn't be that busy at work but still that bit of anxiety was there so I would just scroll the internet, listen to things to escape from it. 

Now I want to take back control of my mind. I want to use the most powerful thing I own which is my attention.
