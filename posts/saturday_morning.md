# Journal Entry

This morning I woke up quite early at 5 o'clock and it was very pleasant. Ordering your coffee while its still dark out and everyone is still asleep is very peaceful. The day before I couldn't sleep because I was all amped up thinking about new ideas, so yesterday after drinking a few beers with friends I passed out at 9 pm.

Today I am trying to buy a used piano for a $150 and am quite excited about it. This week I also started streaming and I would like to maybe stream myself playing some piano. I've been working a lot on my creative set up.

I have ideas of streaming myself playing the piano, coding, drawing. It could be oh so much fun creating a stream that's a chill fun environment to watch. I've got ideas of setting up a tripod in a very scenic area and recording some nice nature videos. A lot can be accomplished with just an iphone. Although I would need a better recording set up for audio. If I could record my piano beautifully that would be amazing.

As far as today I think I would like to do another stream setting up a chainlink operator node and potentially be able to deploy it on aws. Maybe even set it up with juju I feel like that would maybe be better since you need some persistant storage
