# Journal Entry

This morning I woke up quite early at 5 o'clock and it was very pleasant. Ordering your coffee while its still dark out and everyone is still asleep is very peaceful. The day before I couldn't sleep because I was all amped up thinking about new ideas, so yesterday after drinking a few beers with friends I passed out at 9 pm.

Today I am trying to buy a used piano for a $150 and am quite excited about it. This week I also started streaming and I would like to maybe stream myself playing some piano. I've been working a lot on my creative set up.

I have ideas of streaming myself playing the piano, coding, drawing. It could be oh so much fun creating a stream that's a chill fun environment to watch. I've got ideas of setting up a tripod in a very scenic area and recording some nice nature videos. A lot can be accomplished with just an iphone. Although I would need a better recording set up for audio. If I could record my piano beautifully that would be amazing.

As far as today I think I would like to do another stream setting up a chainlink operator node and potentially be able to deploy it on aws. Maybe even set it up with juju I feel like that would maybe be better since you need some persistant storage

## Journal 2/5

Today I woke up very well rested. I have been focusing on my breathing more and I think it is so important for your life. Maybe the most important thing. I heard from Gary Brecka that your energy levels depend on your oxygenation levels in your blood stream and testosterone is... I don't remember the correct term but it either facilitates or helps the transport of oxygen into the blood stream. Makes sense to me. I don't question it. 

A week ago there was a great church service I went to at Christian Life Austin. The Pastor, Sam Lee talked about how we need to expand our tents to let more people into the church and accept people that don't walk the same way, talk the same way, or think the same way.

#### *Isiah 54:2*

```
"Enlarge the place of your tent, stretch your tent curtains wide, do not hold back;
lengthen your cords, strengthen your stakes. For you will spread out to the right
and to the left; your descendants will dispossess nations and settle in their desolate
cities. "Do not be afraid; you will not suffer shame.
```

I think there is room to expand on the metaphor as well. I belive that we need to expand the territory in our mind so it is filled with holy things. Your day to day habits direct your attention so we need to be mindful and set an intention to our actions. So for me, I personally want to spend less time scrolling and more time being creative or at least consuming material that gives you the right kind of energy. The internet is almost designed to make you angry or in fear.

Another way I would like to expand my tent is set aside time for meditation. I've been doing it more in the morning but I need to do it every day. I need to be perfect with my practice. 

The last part is don't hold anything back. We need to be zealots in our ways of providing the good news of Jesus. We are here as Christians on this earth to spread peace and harmony to the nations of people. We need to be strong and fight evil but we also must be unabashed in our faith of the future.

By also creating more patience and more space in our own heart and mind we are able to increase our compassion for others and let others into our lives. That is really the goal. To Love your Neighbor as you love yourself. You are commanded to love yourself.

In closing, I want to block out more chunks of time to work on expanding my tent daily. One of task is I just got a piano so I will be spending time there working on learning it. I guess I need to work on a being stringent to my calendar and my todo list for the day so I can expand the hours of my day that I am doing mindful and fruitful activities. 

This has been a great morning and a great week. All I really ever wanted to do was take control over my mind. Growing up I felt a good amount of negative feelings probably like everyone else and that caused me to want to be alone and work on things. being a part of something really does make you happier. Being here in austin mostly alone really caused me a good amount of loneliness and I think it was prolonged by going out and drinking. I've been pretty sober for the last few months and when I do drink I don't do it excessively so I'm drunk. I think that is a very important aspect of gaining control over my mind.

Anyways I have a deep desire to create and build projects. Maybe today would be best to work on a project like chainlink.
