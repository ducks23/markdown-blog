# Day 2

Today I finished my breathing exercise and many things came to my mind on what to write about. A big one is forgiveness. I believe it is something that many people struggle with especially those who try and keep themselves to a high standard. I had a friend who called me recently and he has had a very difficult life with a difficult upbringing and that has caused him to be in pain and be selfish towards others. he has gotten sober and now is reflecting on all the things he has done and what hurts him most now isn’t the drugs, or alcohol, or the abusive family members it is the heaviness of guilt that he lives with for his actions. The conscience is a funny thing. There is no act that you do towards others that escapes your conscience. 

And from my point of view is people are rather forgiving towards others. We generally don’t think about other people as much as we think about ourselves and we want others to get better and do better so we often forgive others. But we remember so clearly every mistake that we do and I believe that is the hardest part. To show forgiveness and compassion towards your own soul I believe is the only way to move on in your life.

It is also a general human belief that we shouldn't judge children as harshly as we judge adults. For they know not what they do. But we don’t give that mercy to ourselves from yesterday. It is not easy but I think that is the only way to love ones soul. God shows mercy to us so we must also show mercy to ourselves.
