# Good Morning

Here I am at the keyboard again excited to be alive. In the last couple of days I've been having a great time. I'm pretty close to figuring out how to set up a stream. It takes a lot of work to make it look perfect. The next thing I want to do is get it to stream to multiple streams. So I will be streaming on twitch rumble and youtube. Youtube is the worst when it comes to censorship.

I'm really excited about streaming, influence and community are really the strongest thing in the world against evil. I think it would be great if people spend time hanging out in my stream compared to all of the filth that exists in the world. God is great. There are many things that I want to do on stream. I want to read some great books, I want to eventually play the piano once I am good enough. I also want to record some beautiful videos.

But there is so much to do to improve the stream
1. [ ] Set Up multiple streams
2. [ ] Get Excellent Microphone
3. [ ] Get some cool videos of scenic areas
4. [ ]
