# Day 3 / How Great It Is To Be Alive

Today it is below freezing in Austin Texas and I had a cozy session meditating and praying this morning with a warm latte and my dog nearby. I ended my meditation by praying and having a conversation with God and I thought about how great it is to be alive. Considering it is the year 2024 and you are on the internet, you may be surprised to see that point of view being expressed, but I think it is the only correct one. I want to live life speaking powerfully and positively everywhere I go and to everyone I speak to. I really do think that is what being a christian is. You realize that your Lord Jesus has the highest authority in the world. All humans, Governments, and the Devil bow down to Jesus because he is all powerful. And in my mind I know that I have a connection to Jesus so he gives me a shield of power to deflect every attack by the devil, and every negative seed that is sewn in my mind is uprooted and thrown away by my belief that Jesus was sent to earth 2000 years ago by his father so that he would die on the cross and rise three days later to save humanity.

I want anyone who is reading this to be so irrationally optimistic about their life, because that is what the world needs right now. It is so easy to get lost in the trap of thinking AI is going to take away all of our jobs or the cost of living is too high. All of these fears are external and God has shown us that joy is found internally. To find peace and to have a relationship with God brings me to 2 bible verses. 
```
Matthew 6:33
 But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.

Luke 17:20-21
 The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
```

These two verses are so meaningful yet so simple at the same time. These remind me that my internal state and my relationship with the spirit of God is the most important thing. These verses don't say make a million dollars and live in a mansion then you will be happy. It actually says the opposite. They say that your internal state is what brings  I always want outwardly possessions and feelings to make me feel better but Jesus Christ has already told us how to find the kingdom of God and how to attain everything we ever wanted, by going inside of ourselves.
