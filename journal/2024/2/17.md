Today is saturday and I had a really fun friday night last night. I went to top golf with my hockey team and kristen and we had a blast. Right now kristen left to set up and prepare for her market. She is so dedicated to her crocheting.

but yeah what do I want to do today? I kinda do want to write some code and stream. I guess that means that I will need to get some good food in me. I will need to work out and I will also need to decide on what I want to code. It would be nice to finally get my blog finished to send the emails and to be able to be added to my email list. That would be fun. Making websites is pretty fun. I really like this font on my keyboard as well. Maybe I should research kristens pregnancy. That would be funny if I just coded like a monster and took adderal and just went to town.

I should probably read some of the bible. 

That donut made me a little sleepy and made my hands ache. Should not have a had that donut but it it was sooooooooo good. Me is kind of tired though. I don't feel like I really have the energy to start coding right now. but I do at the same time.
